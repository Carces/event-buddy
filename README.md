# Event Buddy App

Event Buddy is an app for people who like to go to festivals/concerts/gigs and would like to find someone to go with.
You have your own custom profile that showcases your interests to others and connect through similar interests. 
Users are then able to communicate and organise which events to go to together and discuss any travel arrangements.
Finally, users are also able to search events by location or name and see who else is going to these events.
